Let's take my two-year experience working in the RoboMaster team as an example. Starting from my freshman year, I studied some algorithms, control principles, PID algorithms, and more related to robot control in the RM laboratory. Although there are many daily courses, I still insist on clocking in at least 25 hours of study and work in the laboratory every week. I also gained recognition from the project management personnel. In the second year, as the electrical control leader of the "Hero Robot", I solved the problem of algorithm control development for the Hero Robot. Finally, I participated in the Robomate University Alliance Competition in 2023 and won the first prize at the national level. During the competition, we also communicated with teams from other schools, which not only broadened my horizons but also made me realize my shortcomings.
